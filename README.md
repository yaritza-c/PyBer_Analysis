analyze rideshare data

## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to obtain enough data on how much money the company has obtained from the months of January to early May of 2019 in the suburban, rural, and urban areas.

## Results
After analyzing all the data, I concluded the area most utilized in the months of January to May of 2019 is the urban areas. The rural areas had the most expensive fare for each ride but had the least amount utilized. And the suburban area was right in-between both urban and rural results.

## Summary
In conclusion, maybe if we lower the rates in the rural locations, we may attract more customers to use the fare in this area. If we raise the rate in the suburban and urban areas to compensate for the rural area, we could see more revenue.
